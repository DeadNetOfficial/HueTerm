# What is HueTerm
HueTerm is a Bash utility which can perform several Philips Hue light commands on Philips Hue light bulbs.
You can use it for whatever you want. Create automated scripts that blink the lights if there are updates available. Control your lights with just your voice. You decide how you use HueTerm.

# Installation
